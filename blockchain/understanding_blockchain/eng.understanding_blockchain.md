# Understanding blockchain.

The things that is naming right now like blockchain - is one of translations of the fundamental mechanism that is allowing to operate numerous (group or set of) elements like The One (The One Piece).

One of the most illustrious examples might be - just a wall. Wall in any office, wall in any apartments or house, any other wall in anywhere. The wall might be made of bricks and cement matrix, might be made of boards and nails and might be made of other variations of materials. But when we are required mentioning "wall" - we are mentioning "wall" but not 15435 bricks and 2 tons of cements matrix or 453 boards and 1654 nails. And in turn of necessity to explain the properties of "the wall" - we are talking about bricks, cement, boards, nails or other materials.

This image is showing the "wall" (blockchain), that is set of bricks (elements), that is fastened (blocked) with cement matrix in certain or special order (block of chained elements). In the context "wall" - the element "brick", but in context "house" - the element "wall" and in context "brick" - the element is the ingredient that is required by the recipe (block of chained elements) of creating bricks, and further in context of every ingredient presented chemical formula based on chemical elements and etc. From the point of view of The Informational Theory this approach described in article ["Spiralnoyes"](https://github.com/alexandrkirilov/kirilov_articles/blob/master/unsorted/spiralnoyes/eng.spiralnoyes.md).

Any human being is using it from begin but without paying any attention for it. It's from our nature. The list of examples might be prolonged endlessly:

* Words formation - when we are composing from symbols the words in context of described object, then from words we are composing sentence in following of context of describing situation, then from sentences we are composing the text in following of idea
* In Chemistry the composing objects from elements 
* Another one example is the popular British nursery rhyme and cumulative tale ["This Is the House That Jack Built"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_the_House_That_Jack_Built)
* etc

The basis for creating The One (blockchain) from set of elements (chain of elements) - is always ["idea"](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/idea), this term came from Greek. The original meaning "form" or "view" (in meaning of imagination). The basis is "idea" that is explaining getting as result the "form". In following the "idea" we are choosing the means and components (elements) that is presented around. If we have no any required component (element), we have to go deeper on level of components and create "idea of component" and get this component before getting realisation of the root "idea". If it going to be explained on previous image, it looks like you will never build the house while you have no oxygen that is required for water by chemical formula that is using for creating bricks that is using for building walls contained the house. Does it looks familiar? Is this in house That Jack Build?

Or in another case, you've been changing the properties of the water and then you will need at least rebuild the house or in worst case it became impossible to build the form based on idea "house".

If the "idea" require you to build statical object, you will be required to describe statical object - for the example might be used the article ["Blockchain example. Desktop/Mobile application implementation."](https://github.com/ArboreusSystems/arboreus_articles/blob/master/blockchain/bc_example_desktop_mobile_application/eng.bce_desktop_mobile_application.md). This example illustrating the statical object - application, that has to be unchanged on user's side.

If the "idea" require you for building dynamically changed object - you have to fix the formula of changing that is unique for this object that is allowing statically fix the ability to be changed in a certain order. For illustration of this approach you might to read the article ["Blockchain example. Events flow implementation."](https://github.com/ArboreusSystems/arboreus_articles/blob/master/blockchain/bc_example_event_flow/eng.bce_events_flow.md). This example showing dynamically changed flow of events, where the events is adding to the flow and by this changing the state of the flow in precise order. This "precise order" (block) is the statical structure of the event flow (chain of events) that is making possible to be unchanged the structure of the flow (blocked chain of events) independently of the kind of events and the time.

If you are trying to fix statically dynamical object, you will always be required to recalculate the object (this is what using in blockchain right now, in classical way that is described in [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain) it will require you to recalculate the "root hash") and fix every changed state of object. Sooner or later, depend on the size of the object, it will be made impossible to use this object because of:

* absence of computing power
* very high the price for calculation 
* etc

Every object on our planet has critical value - critical size, critical mass and etc.

For avoiding of being self-stubbed we need to define the "idea". This "idea" will show what is statical and what is dynamical. And if we are creating statical - we are blocking statical structure, and if we are creating the dynamical object - we are fixing the formula of dynamic changing. Just imagine the situation when 3D Animation is using list of coordinates of positions of the objects instead of using mathematical formulas that is describing the object movement. Got an Imagination? Like it?
