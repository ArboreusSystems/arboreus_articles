# Blockchain: Prerequisites.

For the beginning need to make clear the meaning of the term - "blockchain". In accordance of the public source:

* [en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)

Blockchain - is the technology for storing data, where the structure of storing organized in special manner by the binding elements of the structure to each other by special algorithm. And this approach is translation of global mechanism that is described in the article ["Understanding blockchain."](https://github.com/ArboreusSystems/arboreus_articles/blob/master/blockchain/understanding_blockchain/eng.understanding_blockchain.md).

Now a lot of people connecting this term to the money. It's happening only because this term has been started to be advertised since 2008 because of Bitcoin appearance. The Bitcoin started to use "blockchain" for ensuring safety of the transaction and advertising it like advantage of this system. Subsequently has been added P2P technology stack - Torrent's approach of spreading datum (most likely it was an attempt of seeking solution for minimising the price for holding servers, something like getting enthusiasts equipped by computers for providing services of accessing to data). In result we got what we got - our imagination of what is "blockchain".

This learning of it - only result of proclamation and became slightly connected to matter of it. This understanding is wrong and blocking to use it widely.

The "blockchain" - only the technology that is using for ensuring  additional level of data security and avoiding any attempt of data fraud. Need to mark especially - additional level, means not only "blockchain". Only because of main property of this technology - security improve, it became popular in financial, especially electronic financial solutions where huge ability to make the fraud from begin.

Next one delusion - "blockchain" new and modern technology. It's wrong again. The best example of using it might be found in early 2000th. The Mercedes, BMW, Toyota, Cadillac started to use it for avoiding fraud for car millage. It looks like the millage value stored in couple of sensors hidden in the body of the car and the value that we see on odometer is the result of calculation of values from couple of sensors equipped within memory. Does it looks familiar?

In early 2000th already been using it for ensuring strict and controlled access to the critical data through the desktop applications for the case of avoiding uncontrolled access to secured information. It was more then 15 years ago. For now it might be used in mobile too. You might to get example from article ["Blockchain example. Desktop/Mobile application implementation."](https://github.com/ArboreusSystems/arboreus_articles/blob/master/blockchain/bc_example_desktop_mobile_application/rus.bce_desktop_mobile_application.md)

Now the time for making understandable this term - blockchain. At the begin it was separated two words "block chain". Look into dictionaries again:

* meaning of the "block"
	* [in Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/block)
	* [in Merriam Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/block)
* meaning of the "chain"
	* [in Cambridge Dictionary](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/chain)
	* [in Merriam Webster Dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/chain)

Paraphrasing the dictionaries in context of using it for building data storages and developing application might be gotten this explanation:

**Blockchain - is a structure that organised in special order, where every element of this structure connected to other by special algorithm when any attempt to change element of the structure will affect connected elements.**

In other words - you don't able to change any element without affecting others. The structure of relations between elements is the block for chain of the elements. Especially noticed that in blockchain definition not mentioned that is only for data storing, this approach might be used for a lot of cases.
