# Blockchain

The series of articles about blockchain solution that is illustrating examples from real world and real projects.

* [Prerequisites](https://github.com/ArboreusSystems/arboreus_articles/blob/master/blockchain/prerequisites/eng.blockchain_prerequisites.md): the income info about blockchain term and the short of history of it
* [Understanding Blockchain](https://github.com/ArboreusSystems/arboreus_articles/blob/master/blockchain/understanding_blockchain/eng.understanding_blockchain.md): the description of what is blockchain
```
The author note. Currently we've got a huge 
risk of getting blockchain fundamental 
technology to be compromised because of 
finantial fraud covered by this term. 
The blockchain technology doesn't responsible 
if someone decided to use it for fraud.
